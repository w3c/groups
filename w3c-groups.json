  "description": "The ACT Rules Community Group (previously known as Auto-WCAG), is an open forum set up to document and harmonise the interpretation of W3C accessibility standards, such as WCAG and WAI-ARIA, for testing purposes.\r\n\r\nThe ACT Rules Community Group (ACT-R) achieves this by bringing together the people developing, implementing and using various accessibility testing tools and methodologies to document interpretations as test rules. Test rules are defined using the ACT Rules Format, and reviewed by the community. The process of researching, documenting, and sharing knowledge from different perspectives within the group, builds towards a common understanding. Publishing rules is not an end point for harmonization, it's a starting point. By publishing such test rules, ACT-R hopes to motivate organisations to share their own insights, and encourage adoption of commonly agreed test rules.\r\n\r\nACT-R is not set up to remove differences or impose changes on accessibility testing tools and methodologies. There is value in innovation and diverse approaches. Rather it aims to contribute to more consistent results, regardless of how the testing is done. Knowing when something meets a requirement, and when it does not, should be clear and consistent. \r\n\r\nThis group will not publish specifications.",

Unlike cloud computing, edge computing emphasizes activities that occur closer to the user; these could include accessibility oriented user-agent extensions, applications on content delivery networks, JavaScript-enabled capabilities, AI or ML. The group is a forum for discussing both currently available products, potentially new applications not yet commercially available, as well as objective measures of the quality of any one of these. Our tasks can include inventorying both opportunities and challenges, drafting and incubating Internet specifications for further assessment, standardization, prototyping and testing of reference implementations.

  "description": "Over the past decade, a growing number of sound and imaging media formats have been established offering increasingly sophisticated user experiences such as High Dynamic Range (HDR) and Spatial Audio. On the imaging side, these media formats provide the technical means to facilitate increased spatial and temporal resolutions, higher bit depths, as well as varying color volumes and the mapping between them. Similarly, on the audio side, higher bit-depth, sample rates and more immersive surround sound and speech processing options are available.\r\nThese experiences are facilitated through tools and technical mechanisms available to both professional and consumer content providers and are readily available for linear content types. However, options to provide such experiences through the web are still limited as potential solutions are fragmented and often insular or significantly limited in capabilities among open source as well as proprietary options. This typically results in incorrect presentation to an end user or even error messages. \r\nTherefore, there is need to consider how to support modern audiovisual formats in a W3C context. To alleviate friction in development and deployment, it seems highly beneficial to our community to synchronize open and proprietary solutions so that they can co-exist within a W3C framework. The scope of this community group is to provide a forum for those discussions.\r\n",

  "description": "Being able to efficiently collect, analyse and leverage data insights from buildings is a catalyst for optimising building performance, improving the use of resources and moving towards predictive maintenance and buildings that can respond  to the climate emergency.\r\n\r\nThe lack of standardised naming and labelling for connected devices in the built environment means we are failing to leverage the value of data to allow interoperability, improve building efficiency and increase occupant productivity. \r\n\r\nA naming and labelling standard (complementing other industry initiatives) will simplify and drive consistency thus increasing value by unlocking the application of technologies such as machine learning.  \r\n\r\nThe work of this community group will align with and complement other initiatives in the industry such as BRICK, Haystack, Omniclass, Uniclass, IFC etc. \r\n\r\nIn scope for this work are:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A simple specification for naming syntax</li>\r\n<li>A register of building device names and labels</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

  "description": "<p>The real world is frustratingly uncertain, incomplete and inconsistent. This is challenging for traditional approaches to information systems, and a new paradigm is needed that combines symbolic and statistical techniques, building upon decades of work in the cognitive sciences, and over 500 million years of natural selection. This will allow us to create cognitive agents that learn and reason based upon prior knowledge and past experience, and which can satisfy the need for, transparency in decision making, and continuous learning for adapting to ever changing needs. This community group will address opportunities for cognitive agents using graphs, statistics, rules and graph algorithms, starting with an amalgam of RDF and Property Graphs, together with Web architecture for cognitive databases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More specifically, the Cognitive AI Community Group will work on use cases and requirements, demo's,  open source, and scaling experiments.

  "description": "The concept of consent plays an essential role in the use of digital technologies as an enabler of the individual’s ownership, control, and agency. Regulations such as the GDPR assert this relationship by permitting use of consent as one of the possible legal bases for the lawful practice of data processing. Through this, obtaining consent is widely practised in the digital world, and can be perceived as an essential means to enable the individual’s agency regarding the management and ownership of their personal data. While different legal frameworks specify various requirements and obligations regarding the legal validity of consent, which should be, e.g. valid, freely given, specific, informed and active; existing and ongoing research shows that the majority of people are not empowered to practice their digital right to privacy and lawful \"consenting\" due to various malpractices and a lack of technological means acting in the individuals' interest.\r\n \r\nThis group aims to contribute towards the empowerment of humans concerning their rights of privacy and agency, by advocating interdisciplinary, pluralist, human-centric approaches to digital consent that are technologically and legally enforceable.\r\n \r\nThe mission of this group is to improve the experience of digital \"consenting\" while ensuring it remains adherent to relevant standards and laws. For this, the group will: (i) provide a space for people and stakeholders to come together (ii) highlight and analyse concepts, issues and problems about digital consenting (iii) propose and develop solutions. Some concrete areas for the working of this group are: (a) developing interdisciplinary solutions; (b) documenting and achieving legal compliance; (c) improving the user experience; and (d) utilising existing and developing new concepts and standards for digital consent.

We want users to be able to tell when content is reliable, accurate, and shared in good faith, and to help them steer away from deceptive content. At the same time, we affirm the need for users to find the content they want and to interact freely in the communities they choose. To balance any conflict between these goals, we are committed to providing technologies which keep end-users in control of their Web experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group's primary strategy involves data sharing on the Web, in the style of schema.org, using existing W3C data standards like JSON-LD.  We believe significant progress toward our goals can be reached by properly specifying \"credibility indicators\", a vocabulary/schema for data about content and the surrounding ecosystem, which can help a person and/or machine decide whether a content item should be trusted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please see the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"wiki/\">group wiki</a> for more details.</p>",

Since then, the DPVCG has worked to fulfil its aims and objectives, and produced the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.w3.org/ns/dpv\" target=\"_blank\">Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV)</a> as a deliverable. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Membership to the group is open to all interested individuals and organisations. To join the group, you need a valid W3C account &#8211; which is free to get and can be <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.w3.org/accounts/request\" target=\"_blank\">requested here</a>. The group meets usually through online meeting calls, details of which, including past minutes, can be <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.w3.org/community/dpvcg/wiki/Meeting_Calls\" target=\"_blank\">found here</a>. The group also interacts through a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/\" target=\"_blank\">mailing list</a> regarding topics, discussions, sharing of agendas, actions, and other relevant items. The resources and work relevant to the group is hosted on the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/dpvcg/\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub platform under the DPVCG name</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group is currently chaired by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://harshp.com\" target=\"_blank\">Harshvardhan J.

For past work, actions, issues, and records &#8211; please refer to the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.w3.org/community/dpvcg/wiki/\">wiki</a> and threads on the <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">mailing list</a>. Anyone can use the <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">mailing list</a> to ask questions, suggest topics, raise issues, and offer solutions. Non-members might receive an automated reply asking them to authenticate their email or email address for posting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, calls are usually open to attend, with the agenda shared on the public mailing list. Call details may be shared on the internal mailing lists accessible to only members for security purposes &#8211; so it may be best to ask the chair(s) or a member for attending a call.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>General questions regarding what the group considers in scope can be determined from the aims and objectives. Specific queries or propositions should be conveyed to the mailing list. For issues regarding the DPV, including addition of concepts or a query or other relevant topics &#8211; you can use the mailing list or the issues feature in a <a href=\"https://github.com/dpvcg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub repo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The DPV is a vocabulary (terms) and an ontology (relationships) serialised using semantic-web standards to represent concepts associated with privacy and data protection, primarily derived from GDPR. It enables representation of which <em>personal data categories</em> are undergoing a what kind of <em>processing</em> by a specific <em>data controller</em> and/or transferred to some <em>recipient</em> for a particular <em>purpose</em>, based on a specific <em>legal basis</em> (e.g., consent, or other legal grounds such as legitimate interest, etc.), with specified <em>technical and organisational measures and restrictions</em> (e.g., storage locations and storage durations) in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DPV is useful as a machine-readable representation of personal data processing and can be adopted in relevant use-cases such as legal compliance documentation and evaluation, policy specification, consent representation and requests, taxonomy of legal terms, and annotation of text and data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DPV is an evolving vocabulary &#8211; as the DPVCG continues to work on updating it with broader concepts as well as enriching its hierarchy of concepts. For this, we invite contributions of concepts, use-cases, requirements, and applications.</p>\r\n\t\r\n",

These should cover the majority of 3D use cases for the Web - but not necessarily all of them. There are upcoming open (e.g., WebGL) and proprietary (e.g., Adobe) proposals for imperative graphics APIs in the Web context but we are missing an easy way to add interactive high-level declarative 3D objects to the HTML-DOM to allow anyone to easily create, share, and experience interactive 3D graphics - with possibly wide ranging effects similar to those caused by the broad availability of video on the Web. The goal of this CG is to evaluate the necessary requirements for a successful standardization of a declarative approach to interactive 3D graphics as part of HTML documents.",

The Equity CG will discuss approaches to creating more equitable specifications and implementations of those specifications. The group will determine whether it wants to address internal specifications (as in a self-review questionnaire before CR) or provide a tool for assessing equity (like WCAG). This will require recruiting experts in equity as well as those who reflect the diversity of the world and will take time. In time, the CG hopes to propose an Equity Horizontal Review Board (HRB).",

It should work with existing platform APIs such as Direct3D 12 from Microsoft, Metal from Apple, and Vulkan from the Khronos Group. This API will also expose the generic computational facilities available in today's GPUs to the Web, and investigate shader languages to produce a cross-platform solution. Please see the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://gpuweb.github.io/admin/cg-charter.html\">draft charter</a>.

  "description": "Building Web APIs seems still more an art than a science. How can we build APIs such that generic clients can easily use them? And how do we build those clients? Current APIs heavily rely on out-of-band information such as human-readable documentation and API-specific SDKs. However, this only allows for very simple and brittle clients that are hardcoded against specific APIs. Hydra, in contrast, is a set of technologies that allow to design APIs in a different manner, in a way that enables smarter clients.\r\n\r\nThe foundation is laid by the Hydra Core Vocabulary. It defines a number of fundamental concepts, such as hypermedia controls and collections, which allow machines to understand how to interact with an API. Since all information about the API is available in a machine-readable form, completely generic clients become possible. The Core Vocabulary is complemented by Linked Data Fragments, a set of specifications that enable advanced yet efficient client-side querying of Web APIs.\r\n\r\nMore information about these technologies can be found on our homepage: http://www.hydra-cg.com/",

How do we resolve the conflicting requirements of convenience, habit, and context, and still enable a generic toolchain?

  "description": "This group brings together experts in the area of building information modelling (BIM) and Web of Data technologies to define existing and future use cases and requirements for linked data based applications across the life cycle of buildings. A list of recommended use cases will be produced by this community group.  \r\n\r\nThe envisioned target beneficiaries of this group are both industrial and governmental organisations who use data from building information modelling applications and other data related to the building life cycle (sensor data, GIS data, material data, geographical data, and so forth) to achieve their business processes and whom will benefit from greater integration of data and interoperability between their data sets and the wider linked data communities. For example, benefit may be obtained by publishing and combining localised data on new cheaper building materials, energy efficient building devices and systems, along with real time data on weather patterns, energy prices and geodata. By making this data available to applications, they will be better able to support decision makers during the whole of the building life cycle, which includes design, construction, commissioning, operation, retrofitting/refurbishment/reconfiguration, demolition, and recycling of buildings. \r\n\r\nThe group will engage with these beneficiaries through surveys and events organised in conjunction with the affiliated workshop series on Linked Data for Architecture and Construction (LDAC).\r\n",

  "description": "Timing mechanisms allow operations to be executed at the correct time. The Web already has several mechanisms supporting timed operations, including setTimeout and setInterval, as well as controllers for media frameworks and animations. However, the Web lacks support for multi-device timing. A multi-device timing mechanism would allow timed operations across Web pages hosted by different devices. Multi-device timing is particularly important for the broadcasting industry, as it is the key enabler for web-based secondary device offerings. More generally, multi-device timing has wide utility in communication, collaboration and multi-screen presentation. This Community Group aims to define a common, multi-device, timing mechanism and a practical programming model. This will improve the Web as a platform for time-sensitive, multi-device Web applications.\r\n\r\nCharter : http://webtiming.github.io",

These lexicon models are intended to represent lexical entries containing information about how ontology elements (classes, properties, individuals etc.) are realized in multiple languages. In addition, the lexical entries contain appropriate linguistic (syntactic, morphological, semantic and pragmatic) information that constrains the usage of the entry. (2) Demonstrate the added value of representing lexica on the Semantic Web, in particularly focusing on how the use of linked data principles can allow for the re-use of existing linguistic information from resource such as WordNet. (3) Provide best practices for the use of linguistic data categories in combination with lexica. (4) Demonstrate that the creation of such lexica in combination with the semantics contained in ontologies can improve the performance of NLP tools. (5) Bring together people working on standards for representing linguistic information (syntactic, morphological, semantic and pragmatic) building on existing initiatives, and identifying collaboration tracks for the future. (6) Cater for interoperability among existing models to represent and structure linguistic information. (7) Demonstrate the added value of applications relying on the use of the combination of lexica and ontologies. ",

  "description": "Performing Arts Information Representation (PAIR) is a community group dedicated to advancing the use of shared conceptual models for better data interoperability in the performing arts domain. This domain stands to gain tremendous benefit from using Semantic Web technologies as it relies on the interoperability of information across many fields such as event publishing and discovery, digital archiving, and research (to name a few).  \r\n\r\nThe group’s mission is to support the development and use of semantic vocabularies and common representational frameworks to ensure the meaningful sharing and aggregation of information related to the performing arts. \r\n\r\nThis Community Group provides a forum for the exchange of ideas and experiences, scenarios and requirements while bringing together key stakeholders. The group will act as an advocate for representational standardization in the performing arts sector. \r\n\r\nPAIR will strive to develop mutually beneficial collaborations with groups and organizations that are actively working on relevant standards and/or implementations. In particular, the group will work to develop extensions to existing representational standards such as Schema.org and Wikidata so that Performing Arts information can be better understood by search engines and other web applications. \r\n\r\nWhile designing, maintaining and revising vocabularies and foundational specifications for the performing arts, the group will make efforts to involve the performing arts community at large through solicitation of requests, comments and suggestions from non PAIR members. This may take the form of symposiums, workshops, events or community curated open resources. \r\n",

  "description": "The Permanent Identifier Community Group maintains a secure, permanent UL re-direction service for the Web located at w3id.org. Web applications that deal with Linked Data often need to specify and use URLs that are very stable. They utilize services such as the one run by this community to ensure that applications using their URLs will always be re-directed to a working website. The concept operates much like a switchboard, connecting requests for information with the true location of the information on the Web. Entries in the switchboard can be reconfigured to point to a new location if the old location stops working.\r\n\r\nThe community is responsible for all administrative tasks associated with operating the service. The social contract between organizations involved in the community gives each of them full access to all information required to maintain and operate the website. The agreement is setup such that a number of these organizations could fail, lose interest, or become unresponsive for long periods of time without negatively affecting the operation of the site. \r\n\r\n The service operates in HTTPS-only mode to ensure end-to-end security.  This means that it may be used for Linked Data applications that require high levels of security such as those found in the financial, medical, and public infrastructure sectors. \r\n\r\nAll identifiers associated with the service are intended to be around for as long as the Web is around. This means decades, if not centuries. If the final destination for popular identifiers used by this service fail in such a way as to be a major inconvenience or danger to the Web, the community will mirror the information for the popular identifier and setup a working redirect to restore service to the rest of the Web. \r\n\r\nYou may join this community by getting a W3C account and clicking the join button. If you wish to engage the community in discussion about this service for your Web application, please send an e-mail to the public-perma-id@w3.org mailing list. \r\n\r\nThis group does not create specifications.",

Imagine for example a business rule implemented in Schematron that says that a list should contain between 4 and 8 items. If we determine that there are two items then a quick fix will propose to add automatically two more items to the list or if the list has 10 items then a quick fix may propose to delete two items or to split the list in two lists, etc.\r\n\r\n",

Similarly, some specs are implemented on a base technology, which eventually evolves (e.g. SPARQL 1.1 and RDF 1.1), and developers need access to updated tests.\r\n\r\nThis group will create a home for forks of the various test suites that would be appropriate to act as a redirect for existing tests. Test updates will be considered based on the consensus of those invested in the related specifications. Implementation reports can be updated as new reports are received, giving implementations visibility.\r\n\r\nThis group will not publish Specifications.",

Desirable outcomes include the development of educational material (primers, best practices), the application of SHACL to frequently used RDF vocabularies, libraries of constraint components for common constraint types, improved integration with established technologies such as JavaScript, further work on theory and practice around SHACL rules, a compact SHACL syntax, and a SHACL internet protocol. Additional work may go into delivering \"de-facto standard\" fixes to some gaps left in the current SHACL specifications (e.g., handling recursion, and addressing more comprehensive syntax checks).\r\n",

  "description": "<h2>Background</h2>\r\n\r\nScreen capture is useful in many contexts, such as when delivering presentations, collaborating with remote colleagues, or producing local recordings. The Web Platform offers APIs to that end, allowing Web applications to capture screens, windows or tabs, and allowing the captured media to be manipulated in various productive ways.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of these APIs, and the ubiquity of the applications that use them, are a testament to the importance of the work that has been done thus far.\r\n\r\n<h2>Mission</h2>\r\n\r\nWe believe that there is yet more untapped potential in the realm of screen capture. It is our mission to innovate further and unblock additional novel uses of screen capture, creating new business opportunities for developers and enriching the lives of users.\r\n\r\n<h2>Scope</h2>\r\n\r\nAs part of this charter, the Screen capture Community Group is focusing its activities on producing new screen capture APIs and extending existing ones. APIs directly involving screen capture are in scope, as are APIs that would typically be used in tandem with screen capture.\r\n\r\n<h2>Work mode</h2>\r\n\r\nThe group will conduct all of its technical work in public, on GitHub repositories, with a supporting mailing list for logistical and administrative purposes.\r\n\r\nMeetings will normally be public and open to anyone to join. Should the need arise, meetings may be restricted to Community Group participants and guests invited by the group chairs. In either case, a public summary or minutes will be made available publicly.\r\n\r\n<h2>Amendments to this charter</h2>\r\n\r\nThe group chairs can amend the charter.",

  "description": "The mission of this community group is to establish a draft standard for a RDF-based representation of the HTML-vocabulary. With the HTML-vocabulary in RDF, any type of an HTML-document can be meaningfully represented, generated and validated using nothing but standard semantic technologies, without any vendor lock-in. In addition, full provenance can be provided for a generated HTML-document, as every atom of the document can be described and semantically enriched, ex ante (RDF) and ex post (Rdfa). For instance, the originating algorithm that calculates a certain budget amount in a governmental HTML-document can be linked to the table cell containing the very value. HTML-documents have a wide variety of use and so has the HTML vocabulary. The HTML-vocabulary can be used to generate 100% correct HTML or xHTML and to validate this. The HTML vocabulary can be used to model the front end of a website or application, whereas the logic behind the front end can be captured in SHACL Advanced Features, making for a full semantic representation and execution of digital infrastructure, without any vendor lock-in. An HTML-document can be generated with full compliance to laws and regulations, as these norms can be linked and applied while using the HTML-vocabulary. With full provenance, an HTML-document can battle fake news and show realtime how certain sensitive data in the document (privacy, security) was derived.\r\n\r\nThe community group will come up with a 0.1 draft specification. This will be input for a future working group within W3C. The community group can make use of the currently available draft specification as developed by the Dutch Ministry of Finance in a working prototype for the Dutch governmental budget cycle. By starting this community group, the Dutch Ministry wants to contribute to an open source based digital infrastructure.",

One major factor contributing to this mismatch is the signaling between the demand-side (i.e., employers) and supply-side (i.e., education, training and credentialing providers, students and workers) of the talent pipeline. This mismatch frequently results in neither party coming into view of the other. The goal of the Talent Marketplace Signaling (TalentSignal) Community Group is to assist Schema.org in improving workforce signaling by refining existing schema.org types serving the talent pipeline and suggesting new types and properties where improved signaling cannot otherwise be achieved. Currently, workforce signaling sits at the intersection of a number of existing schema.org types: Course, JobPosting, Occupation, Organization, Person and the proposed EducationalOccupationalCredential.</p>\r\n <p>The TalentSignal Community Group will focus initially on refinement of the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://schema.org/JobPosting\">JobPosting Schema</a> and related types as it survey's specifications from domain entities such as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hropenstandards.org/\">HR Open Standards</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.pesc.org/home.html\">PESC</a> as well as the US Chamber of Commerce Foundation's <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/workforce-development/JDX\">Job Data Exchange (JDX)</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/t3-innovation\">T3 Innovation Network</a> initiatives for better means to strong, more effective supply- and demand-side signaling.</p>",

  "description": "Robots.txt is currently based on opting out of what you do not want your website to be a part of. \r\n\r\nThis is hard to maintain (almost a full time job right now) if you do not wish for your websites content to be applied for e.g. training AI, be a part of market research (e.g. price robots), to be a part of non-search engine databases and more.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is to update what type of instructions robots.txt should support to rather be treated as an opt-in, where you can give instructions based on intent of robots rather than a wildcard or in granular detail.\r\n\r\nExample: \r\nAgent-group: searchengines\r\n\r\nApplies to all robots that seeks to update, process or maintain websites for search engine databases. Does not grant permission to apply scraped data for AI purposes (this should have its own Agent-group).\r\n\r\nAlso, the absence of instructions should be treated as not having opted in, and for robots working on behalf of AI, there might need to be additional instructions (e.g. max-snippet and if you require a citation if your content is applied to provide an answer).",

  "description": "Existing W3C voice interaction standards such as VoiceXML are based on use cases centered around telephony-based voice systems. The typical interaction style that these standards support is system-initiated directed dialog using grammars to constrain the speech recognizer. In recent years, interaction with voice applications has become much more flexible, with a user-initiated dialog style and significantly fewer constraints on spoken input. \r\n\r\nMany of these new applications take the form of \"virtual assistants\". These include general-purpose assistants (for example, Siri, Cortana, Google Now and Alexa) as well as virtual assistants with specialized domain expertise. The proposed Community Group will collect new use cases for voice interaction, develop requirements for applications such as virtual assistants and explore areas for possible standardization, possibly producing specifications if appropriate. Depending on interest, this exploration could include such topics as (1) discovery of virtual assistants with specific expertise, for example a way to find a virtual assistant that can supply weather information (2) standard formats for statistical language models for speech recognizers (3) standard representations for references to common concepts such as time (4) interoperability for conversational interfaces and (5) work on dialogue management or  ‘workflow' languages . New functionality for existing voice standards can also be a topic of discussion.\r\nSpeech application developers and voice user interface designers should be particularly interested in this group.",
