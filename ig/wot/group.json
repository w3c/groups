{"id":75874,"name":"Web of Things Interest Group","is_closed":false,"description":"The mission of the Web of Things Interest Group is to counter the fragmentation of the Internet of Things by complementing available standards through Web technology capable of interconnecting existing Internet of Things platforms, devices, gateways, and cloud services. We aim to reduce costs through the global reach of Web standards, to enable open markets of services, and to unleash the power of the network effect. As a W3C Interest Group, we are seeking to build a deeper understanding of the Web of Things by investigating consumer, industrial, environmental, energy management, and smart city scenarios. This is intended to identify demand for further standards-track work within W3C working groups and to better align with the established W3C liaisons.","shortname":"wot","discr":"w3cgroup","type":"interest group","start-date":"2015-01-21","end-date":"2023-12-31","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.w3.org/groups/ig/wot"},"homepage":{"href":"https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/"},"users":{"href":"https://api.w3.org/groups/ig/wot/users"},"services":{"href":"https://api.w3.org/groups/ig/wot/services"},"specifications":{"href":"https://api.w3.org/groups/ig/wot/specifications"},"chairs":{"href":"https://api.w3.org/groups/ig/wot/chairs"},"team-contacts":{"href":"https://api.w3.org/groups/ig/wot/teamcontacts"},"charters":{"href":"https://api.w3.org/groups/ig/wot/charters"},"active-charter":{"href":"https://api.w3.org/groups/ig/wot/charters/454"},"join":{"href":"https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/wot/join"},"pp-status":{"href":"https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/wot/ipr"},"participations":{"href":"https://api.w3.org/groups/ig/wot/participations"}},"identifier":"ig/wot"}
