 "description": "The mission of the CSS Accessibility Task Force (CSS A11Y TF) is to focus effort on identifying accessibility problems that can be created by use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and to develop solutions. Some accessibility issues are not specific to particular modules but the result of complicated interactions between the overall CSS feature set, underlying host language semantics, user agent features, and assistive technologies. These issues are difficult to address in per-specification reviews normally conducted by the APA WG, and require a base of expertise to develop solutions.",
