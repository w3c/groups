 "description": "The mission of the Conversational Interfaces Community Group is to enable web developers to collaborate and share conversational experiences for a variety of domains. Most dialogue systems serve interactive experiences in their own domain specific language, causing a fragmented zoo of proprietary formats. For example, Google Home or Alexa do not share a common intermediate representation, which makes writing wide-spread content inaccessible to the mass audience. We study existing specs and design  standards to harness proven techniques into common agreement. See the <a href=\"https://conversational-interfaces.github.io/charter/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Community Group's charter</a>.",
