 "description": "The objective of this community is to discuss the possibility of creating a schema to describe network maintenance notifications.  This topic has received traction in the industry, and thus a standard should at least be discussed. Currently the industry is adopting embedded metadata within iCalendar attachments, as well as APIs. A standard could be used in both of these scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis group may or may not decide to create specifications.\r\n\r\n",
