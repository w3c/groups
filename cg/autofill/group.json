 "description": "<p>Every day on the web, millions of users enter information into forms to complete journeys ranging from e-commerce, to account creation and log-in, to government services, and more. Given the onerous nature of re-typing information, many user agents and other “Autofill implementors” (e.g., browser extensions) provide “Autofill” services to aid the user in easily filling in forms. However, today, Autofill implementors have a wide range of capabilities and behaviours, such that both users and websites are faced with different experiences depending on the Autofill implementor being used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mission of this group is to provide a forum for Autofill implementors to develop a common understanding of the interface between Autofill and the web page. The group will discuss known issues and develop joint proposals to improve the developer experience, focusing on explicit website signals, client-side data representation, and the mechanics of form filling. Internal implementation details, such as proprietary heuristics or backend data processing, are out of scope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This group may publish Specifications.</p>",
