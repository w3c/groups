 "description": "<p>The aim of the Rights Automation for Market Data Community Group is to develop and publish a market-data profile for ODRL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Market data is mostly the pricing and trading data for financial instruments (and their associated indices) generated by trading venues. The licenses controlling its use are frequently complex, and tightly segment the underlying data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will model these licenses using ODRL and extend the language with a profile that defines the new terms required. This group will publish Specifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a standard, machine-readable way of describing market data licenses, we can look towards automating rights-management along the market data supply chain and drive efficiencies in financial markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group welcomes the involvement of domain experts in licensing (especially market data) and those skilled in modeling licenses (especially using ODRL).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are not a group participant you can still <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"mailto:public-md-odrl-profile-request@w3.org?Subject=Subscribe\">subscribe to our list</a>.</p>",
