 "description": "This mission of this group, initiated by LRMI, is to develop an extension for schema.org concerning the discovery of any type of educational course (online/offline, long/short, scheduled/on-demand). Educational course is  defined as \"some sequence of events and/or creative works which aims to build the knowledge, competence or ability of learners\". (Out of scope: information about students and their progression etc; information needed internally for course management rather than discovery).",
