 "description": "<p>Semantic representation is a fundamental enabler across various application domains, including multi-agent systems. The OASIS ontology (Ontology for Agents, Systems, and Integration of Services) offers a formal and shared framework for modeling agents, interactions, processes, procedures, and events. Developed over several years, OASIS has found applications in areas such as e-commerce and blockchain technologies. The mission of this group is to advance its formalization by leveraging Semantic Web technologies.</p>",
