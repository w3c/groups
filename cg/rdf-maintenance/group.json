 "description": "<p>  The mission of this group is to help maintain some of the Notes originally published by the W3C Semantic Web Interest Group (now closed). This\r\n  group will identify potential modifications to those Notes that account for changes to RDF, SPARQL, SHACL, OWL and other core standards,\r\n  as well as the evolution of the supporting community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Note: The original Notes were published with a document license that does not allow for derivative works without permission. The W3C staff\r\n  is investigating the topic in search of an approach to enable Community Groups to evolve Specifications originally published under the\r\n  W3C Document License.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> This group expects to publish Specifications.</p>",
