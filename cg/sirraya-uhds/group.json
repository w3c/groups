 "description": "<p>The mission of this group is to define a universal, modular, and interoperable set of data schemas for health information. Our goal is to enable the aggregation and utilization of data for medical research and AI training through privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) like Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), while ensuring patient control and consent via Verifiable Credentials (VCs).</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Scope and Problem Statement</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The development of robust medical AI is hampered by siloed, non-standardized, and sensitive health data. Current data formats are incompatible across institutions, and privacy regulations prevent the sharing of raw data, creating a significant barrier to collaborative research. This group will address this by creating schemas that transform health data into standardized, verifiable, and privacy-preserving assets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Key Deliverables</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A core set of modular, extensible Verifiable Credential schemas for common medical data types (e.g., lab results, imaging reports, prescriptions, diagnoses)</li>\r\n<li>Best practice guidelines for issuing these VCs from trusted sources (e.g., hospitals, clinics)</li>\r\n<li>Specifications for generating Zero-Knowledge Proofs from these VCs to enable privacy-preserving queries and analytics</li>\r\n<li>Use cases and implementation patterns for federated learning and AI model training using the proposed schemas and ZKP protocols</li>\r\n</ul>",
