 "description": "<p>The group will incubate specifications for decentralized web applications, with a goal of enhancing security, privacy, and efficiency through the use of blockchain technologies. Our first deliverable will comprise a list of value-adds and benefits that blockchain technology may be able to provide for the World Wide Web community. \r\n Subsequently, based on our findings, we aim to agree on a set of general, high-level requirements and capabilities that blockchain-based application architectures would need to fulfill in order to deliver value. Finally, we aim to explore the potential impacts of these architectures on the privacy, resiliency, incentives, and accessibility of the web, and to establish relationships with other groups to ensure alignment as these solutions are developed.</p>",
