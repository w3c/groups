The SocialCG provides space to collaborate and coordinate for implementors who are building on any of the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/social-web-protocols/\">specifications published by the Social Web WG</a>, and related technologies. It is also a place to incubate new proposals which build on or complement the Social Web WG recommendations.<br><br>\r\n\r\nDiscussions and meeting announcements happen on <a href=\"https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/\">the SocialHub forum</a> or on project-specific version control repositories.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMeetings are not always weekly, but can be requested or convened by any member of the group. If you have a specific item to discuss, please contact a chair if you need help with <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/wiki/SocialCG#Meetings\">meeting logistics</a>, and make a post on the SocialHub forum, ideally with two or more weeks notice.","shortname":"socialcg","discr":"w3cgroup","type":"community group","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.w3.org/groups/cg/socialcg"},"homepage":{"href":"https://www.w3.org/community/socialcg/"},"users":{"href":"https://api.w3.org/groups/cg/socialcg/users"},"services":{"href":"https://api.w3.org/groups/cg/socialcg/services"},"chairs":{"href":"https://api.w3.org/groups/cg/socialcg/chairs"},"join":{"href":"https://www.w3.org/community/socialcg/join"},"participations":{"href":"https://api.w3.org/groups/cg/socialcg/participations"}},"identifier":"cg/socialcg"}
