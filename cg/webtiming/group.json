The <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/community/reports/webtiming/CG-FINAL-timingobject-20241203/\">Timing Object</a> specification was published as a final Community Group Report in the hope that it may prove a useful basis for renewed discussions on a timing model for the Web in the future. Interested parties are encouraged to reach out to the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/me/\">Media and Entertainment Interest Group</a> for coordination, through its <a href=\"mailto:public-web-and-tv@w3.org\">public-web-and-tv@w3.org</a> mailing-list (<a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-web-and-tv/\">archives</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/community/sync-on-the-web/\">Sync on the Web Community Group</a> was also created in January 2025 to identify and define the requirements, solutions, and mechanisms for reproducing sender-side state, including all data, with precise timing and minimal jitter on the client side.</p>",
