Examples of document services include: spellchecking, grammar checking, proofreading, fact checking, mathematical proof checking, reasoning checking, argumentation checking, and narrative checking.\r\n \r\nThe Document Services Community Group intends to, in coordination with other groups, create a general-purpose architecture, API's, and protocols for both free and paid-subscription-based document services to convenience document service providers and to equip and empower end-users who will be able to make use of multiple document services simultaneously to better author and review documents.\r\n",
