By looking across the ecosystem, we hope to improve our specification development practices at the W3C. \r\n\r\n</p><p>As part of this CG, we hope to run hands-on virtual tutorial sessions that will cover:\r\n</p><ul>\r\n<li>spec writing: writing algorithms, types of statements.  \r\n</li><li>tooling: ReSpec and Bikeshed. \r\n</li><li>testing: Web Platform Tests.\r\n</li><li>How review specs: what to look for, commenting on pull requests. \r\n</li><li>leveraging fundamental technologies:  WebIDL, Infra standard, HTML, etc.\r\n</li><li>Using GitHub effectively for spec development: labels, milestones, managing your community. \r\n</li><li>More things!
