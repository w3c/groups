 "description": "<p>The mission of this group is to support the technical implementation of infrastructure and applications for the Circular Economy (CE), and one of its digital cornerstones — Digital Product Passports (DPPs). This community group will complement the work of the ISO/TC 323 on CE standardisation, with discussions from a technical and web-focused perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group will primarily be a discussion group, but may in the future decide to produce reports or other deliverables. This group will not publish Specifications. Starting out, the group will discuss the requirements set by the CE and DPPs on web technologies and standards, to identify standardisation challenges that are not yet met. Group members will share ideas, experiences and thoughts on usage of web technologies in these areas, their strengths and weaknesses, and open challenges — for instance in the form of use cases. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this community group we welcome all parties interested in the technical aspects of CE, and DPP implementation. We envision that participants either have knowledge and expertise on CE and DPPs, e.g. material flows, manufacturing, modelling, or business aspects, so they are able to, for instance, contribute use cases, needs, and test scenarios. Additionally, we welcome participants with knowledge and expertise on web infrastructure, technologies, and standards who are interested in applying their expertise to address CE-related challenges.</p>",
