 "description": "<p>The Cybernetic Avatar Community Group aims to discuss and define technologies, architectures, and data standards for the Cybernetic Avatar — a networked embodiment that digitally extends and transmits human physical, perceptual, and cognitive capabilities on the Web.</p>\n\n<p>A Cybernetic Avatar may appear as a tele-operated robot, a virtual body in an augmented space, or a hybrid embodiment connected to human sensorimotor and cognitive data streams.</p>\n\n<p>The group explores how such embodiment can be realized in browsers and web-based environments to enable inclusive participation in social, creative, and professional activities across distance and time.</p>\n\n<p>The mission is to establish open and interoperable specifications for transmitting and synchronizing multimodal human data — motion, vision, audio, haptics, and cognitive states — between human, avatar, and environments on the Web.</p>",
