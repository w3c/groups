 "description": "<h4>Background</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The utilization of data from locally connected devices has nearly become a reality, thanks to remarkable advancements over the past decade. For instance, the Web MIDI API enables bi-directional communication of MIDI messages between MIDI devices and web browser applications.\r\nNow, with the emergence of new real-time protocols like Media over QUIC, real-time utilization of data from locally connected devices is extending beyond local clients to reach remote clients across the network. This evolution makes such data usage increasingly common on the web.\r\nThese protocol advancements enable the web to deliver orchestrated, immersive experiences that seamlessly integrate virtual and real-world elements in real time.\r\nTo fully leverage these opportunities and ensure precise reproduction of such experiences on client devices, our current focus is on timing synchronization at the sender's side, particularly synchronizing data from locally connected devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Statement</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sync on the Web Community Group defines its mission as follows:</p>\r\n1. Define the use cases that require \"Sync on the Web.\"\r\n2. Identify the conditions and criteria necessary to achieve \"Sync on the Web.\"\r\n3. Collaborate with related working groups to explore potential solutions for \"Sync on the Web,\" including reviewing existing implementations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Out of Scope</h4>\r\n<P>Our primary focus is to identify and define the requirements, solutions, and mechanisms for reproducing sender-side state, including all data, with precise timing and minimal jitter on the client side. As such, Synchronization of data from multiple clients falls outside the scope of this mission.</p>",
