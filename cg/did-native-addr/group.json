 "description": "The mission of this group is to explore,  develop, and promote Universal DID-Native Addressing (UDNA)—a framework that treats decentralized identifiers (DIDs) as first-class network primitives. UDNA enables identity-native communication, privacy-preserving routing, and secure self-sovereign interactions across decentralized systems. Through UDNA, this group aims to unlock secure, decentralized, and privacy-preserving communications at scale, laying the foundation for the next generation of Internet-native identities.\r\n\r\n<p>Scope:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Defining UDNA specifications for DID-based network addressing.</li>\r\n<li>Developing protocols for secure, verifiable, and rotatable identity resolution.</li>\r\n<li>Exploring integration with existing Internet protocols and decentralized networks.</li>\r\n<li>Enabling zero-trust and capability-based access control models.</li>\r\n<li>Investigating privacy-preserving communication and anti-abuse mechanisms.</li>\r\n<li>Providing reference implementations and interoperability guidance.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Expected Outcomes:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A set of specifications and guidelines for UDNA adoption.</li\r\n<li>Reference architectures and implementation examples.</li>\r\n<li>Recommendations for integrating identity-native addressing into decentralized applications and protocols.</li>\r\n<li>A community of researchers, developers, and organizations collaborating on identity-native networking technologies.</li>\r\n</ul>",
