It had produced some early draft specifications for making vehicle signals available in a browser runtime as a first class object. Those specifications were the basis for launching the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/groups/wg/auto/\">W3C Automotive Working Group</a>. The Auto Working Group has since changed to service specifications to expose signals in a broader range of computing environments and bringing this extremely useful telematics information to the cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fuller description of current and evolving scope is in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/2020/auto-transportation-charter\">the charter</a>.</p>",
